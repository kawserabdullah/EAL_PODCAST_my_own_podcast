This is the source code for my own podcast, EAL Podcast. Currently, I am using the default domain of the hosting service. In future, I will purchase a domain for the site. 

Website: https://eal-podcast.vercel.app/.

BTW, I haven't uploaded all the episodes to Spotify yet. I have a plan to do better-quality episodes. Better in the sense of higher audio quality, interesting topics, engaging scripts, and finally, some editing. Visit the link below for all the episodes.
